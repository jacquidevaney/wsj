	The Obama administration Sunday began implementing its landmark nuclear agreement with Iran with an eye toward lifting of the expansive sanctions imposed on Tehran over the past decade.

  <div class="accordion-content default">
    <p>The deal does this: Iran will give up the bulk of its nuclear program, namely its enriched uranium (nuclear fuel) and its centrifuges (which turn fuel into weapons material). That will leave it with a program way too small to build a bomb.
    <br><br>

	Iran will also submit to extremely invasive inspections. That's to make sure it isn't cheating, for example by sneaking nuclear material off to some secret facility and developing a bomb there. The idea is that Iran knows it can't get away with cheating, and will be punished if it does, so it won't try.

	    <div id="accordion">
	In exchange, the world will remove a lot of the economic sanctions it's placed on Iran, and Iran gets to keep just enough of a nuclear program that it can save face.

	  	If the deal works, it will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, it will ease Iran's economic suffering, and it will make war less likely - huge improvements. Arms control experts tend to say this is about the best we could get.
	  	<br><Br>
		If the deal fails, then we will back where we are now, except that it will be much harder to reimpose those tough economic sanctions. That's a possibility, and deal critics have reason to worry. But this is almost certainly the world's best chance for averting both war and a nuclear Iran, and will likely be remembered as a huge legacy achievement for President Obama.

	<p>The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is committed under the deal to release a report by year-end about the status of Iran's alleged weaponization work. But U.S. officials over the weekend said the IAEA report would have no bearing on moves by the international community to lift sanctions on Tehran. </p>

	<p>"That final assessment, which the IAEA is aiming to complete by December 15th, is not a prerequisite for implementation day," a senior U.S. official said Saturday. "We are not in a position to evaluate the quality, as you say, of the data. That is between Iran and the IAEA." </p>

	<p>Secretary of State John Kerry and other U.S. officials had previously said sanctions on Iran wouldn't be lifted unless Tehran substantively cooperated with the U.N. probe.</p>

	<p>The U.S.'s shifting position is stoking criticism from Republicans, who say the White House is essentially agreeing to whitewash the weaponization issue. They also charged Iran with growing more belligerent since the nuclear agreement was reached in July, with Tehran testing a ballistic missile this month and convicting a Washington Post journalist of espionage.</p>

	<p>"In a key test of its commitment to the nuclear agreement, Iran has given minimum cooperation to international inspectors attempting to determine the extent of Iranâ€™s past bomb work," said Rep. Ed Royce (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "If this is what the last 90 days look like, the next few years look like a disaster."</p>

	<p>Steps announced Sunday by the U.S. and its negotiating partners to move ahead on what's come to be known as "adoption day," are intended to show a readiness for sanctions relief if Iran begins scaling back its nuclear infrastructure. That relief will only begin on the day - "implementation day" - when the IAEA certifies Iran has lived up to its commitments to curb its nuclear program.</p>

	<p>Mr. Obama said in a statement that Sunday marks an "important milestone" toward preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and ensuring its nuclear program is peaceful. He said the U.S. will closely monitor Iran's adherence to the commitments made in Vienna.</p>
